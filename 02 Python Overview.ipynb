    "- people propose changes by writing *Python Enhancement Proposals* (PEPs)\n",
    "- the Python core committee will assign a 'dictator' who will decide whether the PEP is worthy of becoming part of the standard, and if so it does, after some amount of discussion and revision\n",
    "- disagreements are finally settled by Guido van Rossum, Python's inventor and the 'Benevolent Dictator for Life' (BDFL)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important standard PEP is the Style Guide, PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). By default, PyCharm will warn of any PEP-8 violations. There are external tools such as `flake8` (https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) that can be used to check code for compliance in other environments.\n",
